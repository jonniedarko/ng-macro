ngMacro:
An Introduction to AngularJS
<p>In this tutorial we will jump head first into building a simple but functional AngularJS
   Application. We will be building a simple Macro Calculator which can calculate the calories,
   protein, Carbs and fats required for increasing muscle, loosing fat or maintaining current
   weight.

<h3 id="whatisangularjs">
   What is AngularJS?
</h3>
<p>AngularJS is an opensource
   structural MVC framework for dynamic web applications which
   aims to make building large scale web applications easier for development, testing and
   maintaining. It was created by Google is maintained by both Google and the AngularJS
   community.
</p>
<h4 id="someofitsmaingoalsinclude">
   Some of Its main goals include:
</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Decoupling DOM manipulation from application logic.</li>
   <li>Improve code testability.</li>
   <li>Decoupling the client side of an application from the server side to allow development work to
      progress in parallel.
   </li>
   <li>Decoupling view from the business logic and data providers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advantagesandwhywherewouldyouuseit">
   Advantages and why/where would you
   use it
</h4>
<ul>
   <li>It does a lot of the Heavy lifting for you, you create your component and AngularJS manages
      those components and the connections between them
   </li>
   <li>Data models in Angular are plain old JavaScript objects (POJO) and don’t require extraneous
      getter and setter functions.
   </li>
   <li>We can create custom reusable HTML elements</li>
   <li>we Can create powerful custom filters which we can use to filter/sort or manipulate data
      using our own custom rules e.g. you could create a filter that removed all vowels from your text
      (see future post)
   </li>
   <li>save writing a lot of repetitive or code.</li>
   <li>Data binding allows instant real time updating without refreshing page</li>
   <li>It is built with Unit Testing in mind and allows for far greater code coverage with less
      effort
   </li>
</ul>
<p>One disadvantage in my opinion is the documentation/developers guide for basics is great
   but when it some to complex examples such as complex directives I found fall shorts, especially
   when it comes to the Unit testing.
</p>
<p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter's Bootstrap</a> is also used in this tutorial but I
   will not be going into detail. In brief Bootstrap is a framework for responsive design which
   contains HTML and CSSbased
   design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and
   other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. In this tutorial we will only
   be using it to "pretty up" our application and give it a polished professional look.
</p>
<p>So Lets get started....</p>
<h4 id="databinding">
   Data Binding
</h4>
<p>The simplest and most basic example of the power and usefulness of AngularJS is in its
   data binding. Most Web frameworks till recently only used single way data binding, for example if
   we wanted to update our model we would make our change and then in order to see the change
   we would have to refresh the view manually. Not in angularJS. In AngularJS we have 2way
   Data
   binding, when we update the view, it updates the model which auto update the views other
   references. Ass Google put it: 
</p>
<blockquote>
   <p>You can think of the view as simply an instant projection of your model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this, the simplest is using 2 of AngularJS's built in
   fundamental capabilities, a "directive" called ngModel and an Angular Expression.
</p>
<p>A directive is a markers on a DOM element such as a css class, element name or attribute
   used to attach some behaviour. We won't go into much detail here on Directives, thats a post in
   its own for later.
</p>
<p>An Angular Expression are JavaScriptlike
   code snippets surrounded by double curly braces
   like:
</p>
```javascript
{{ expression }}
```
<p>Expressions can evaluate AnguarJS variables ,such as those created by an ngModel
   declaration, evaluating math expression as well as calling a function ( this requires a controller
   and $scope which we will introduce later)
</p>
<p>Fiddle Example
   JS Fiddle Data Binding: http://jsfiddle.net/jonniedarko/hmyZB/8/
</p>
<p>So in order to go further with this we need to do a little bit of set up....</p>
<p>Note: I am using <a href="https://www.mamp.info">Mamp</a> as my webServer for this
   tutorial as it doesn't require much setting up, but you can use any webserver you like, in later
   tutorials we will be using node to server our files
</p>
<h4 id="creatingyourfirstangularjsapp">
   Creating your first AngularJS App
</h4>
<p>Inside your htdocs folder create a folder called "ngmacro"
   Create an empty index.html
   Create directory "vendor"
   Download (unzip where required) and add to Vendor: (in Later tutorials we will use bower to do
   all this for us )

   commit/71c56c4ba5d65363339fd4b48ab492c63
   9f31862">commit</a>)</p>
<p>Ok first is first, lets add a few basic ngModels to bind some data. We need to get the users
   height, weight , age, sex and to personalise it their name.
</p>
<p>find the input for the user name and add the ngModel attribute "user.name"</p>
```html
<input type="text" class="formcontrol"
   id="user_name" ngmodule="user.name"
   placeholder="What's your name?">
```
<p>Now do the Same for user.sex, user.height, user.weight, and user.age. While we are at it
   create a new app.js file in out ngmacro
   folder, and Add the following to initialise our Angularjs
   App:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>inside app.js</li>
</ul>
```javascript
var app = angular.module('ngMacro', []);
```
<p>inside our index file change our body tag to:</p>
```html
<body ngapp="ngMacro">
   ```
   <p>and under the dependency scripts include our app.js file </p>
   ```javascript
   <script src="app.js"></script>
   ```
   <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is essential this is included after our AngularJS file and
      AngularJS's dependencies otherwise you will get an <em>Uncaught ReferenceError: angular is
      not defined</em> and possible an <em>Uncaught Error: [$injector:modulerr]</em> in the
      browser Console.
   </p>
   <p>Wondering whats Just Happened with these changes?
      What we did was use AngularJS's <code>module()</code> method to create and register our
      module "ngMacro" with AngularJS. The first argument is the name we give our module, the 2nd
      is an array of dependancies that are required by this module, in our case none.
   </p>
   <p>Code changes so far: <a
      href="https://github.com/jonniedarko/ngmacro/
      commit/1ec55cc5da0753a0cc72b0b93ab363a97
      613bc08">Github commit</a></p>
   <p>So Inorder to take this futher we need to introduce Controllers.</p>
   <h3 id="whatiscontroller">
      what is Controller?
   </h3>
   <p>In Angular, a Controller is a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the
      Angular Scope.
      A scope in AngularJS is an object that refers to the application model and is arraged in a
      hierarchical structure. Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events.
   </p>
   <p>Controllers are used to Set up the initial state of the <code>$scope</code> object and add
      behaviors to it.
   </p>
   <p>So lets creat our first controller. Add the following to our app.js file:</p>
   ```javascript
   app.controller('macroCtrl', function ($scope){
        $scope.user = { };
   });
   ```
   <p>And add it to our container div (div just under our body) as follows</p>
    ```html
        <div ngcontroller="macroCtrl" class="container">
    ```

  <p>Here we are creating a controller "macroCtrl" and we are passing it a new child
     <code>$scope</code> which is an injectable parameter. This is taken care of by AngularJS, we
     just need to include it in our function to use it. We also just initialised the user variable.
     (<strong>note:</strong> inside the controller when we create a variable that can be used in our
     view, index.html, we create it under the <code>$scope</code> variable. This is almost like
     making them public, any variable not attached to the $scope cannot be accessed by our
     view)
  </p>
  <p>So Back to our App. The first thing we need before we can get our suggested Calorie intake
     is caculate the users Basic Metabolic Rate. Lets add some where to view it:
  </p>
  <p>Inside index.html add the following after the last "row" div</p>

  ```html
    <div class="row">
        <div class="colsm12"><p class="bgprimarykcalflash">
            <p><b>&nbsp;{{user.name}}&nbsp;Basic Metabolic Rate: &nbsp;</b>
            &nbsp; {{getMetaRate()}}</p>
      </div>
   </div>
   ```
   <p>create style.css. Add the following just to keep things looking well and don't forget to add in
      our html page's head right after bootstrap
   </p>
   ```css
   .kcalflash{
   padding: 5px;
   paddingleft:
   15px;
   }
   ```
   <p>now lets wire things up...</p>
   <p>Add the following inside our controller.</p>
   ```javascript
   $scope.getMetaRate = function(){
   var meta;
   if($scope.user.sex === "male"){
   meta = (88.362 + (13.397 * parseFloat( $scope.user.weight) )
   +(5.799 * parseFloat( $scope.user.height) )
   (
   5.677 * parseFloat( $scope.user.age) ) || 0 );
   }else if($scope.user.sex === "female"){
   meta = (447.593 + (9.247 * parseFloat( $scope.user.weight) )
   +(3.098 * parseFloat( $scope.user.height) )
   (
   4.33 * parseFloat( $scope.user.age) ) || 0 );
   }
   else meta = null;
   $scope.user.bmr= meta;
   return (!isNaN(meta) &amp;&amp; (meta!=null)) ? parseFloat(meta).toFixed(2) : "Please Fill
   Out the above Form";
   };
   ```
   <p>This might seem scary at first but once you have any experience with javascript its fairly
      easy to understand. Simply put it check if the user is male or female and returns the Metabolic
      rate using the user's weight, height and age which by the way are populated automatically when
      the user fills out the form. This is the magic of <code>ngModel</code>. the last line is just to
      make sure out number is returned a number and not as a string.
   </p>

   <p>finally we are going to finish of our app by calculating the Calories and displaying them. Add
      the following to the Index page:
   </p>
   ```html
   <div class="row">
      <div class="colsm12">
         <select name="" id="" class="formcontrol"
            ngmodel="
            user.activityLevel"
            ngchange="{{
            updateNutrition()}}">
            <option value="">Select you Activity Level</option>
            <option ngrepeat="
               activityLevel in activityLevels"
               value="{{activityLevel.value}}">{{activityLevel.title}}</option>
         </select>
      </div>
   </div>
   <div class="row">
      <div class="colsm12">
         <table class="table tablebordered">
            <thead>
               <th></th>
               <td ngrepeat="
                  goal in goals">{{goal.title}}</td>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
               <tr>
                  <td>Calories:</td>
                  <td ngrepeat="
                     goal in goals">{{goal.calories | number:0}}</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>Protien:</td>
                  <td ngrepeat="
                     goal in goals">{{goal.protein | number:0}}</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>Fats:</td>
                  <td ngrepeat="
                     goal in goals">{{goal.fats | number:0}}</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>Carbs:</td>
                  <td ngrepeat="
                     goal in goals">{{goal.carbs | number:0}}</td>
               </tr>
            </tbody>
         </table>
      </div>
   </div>
   ```
   <p>Now thats our view template finished. But it will not look right yet as here we are introducing
      2 more AngularJS directives , <a href="">ngRepeat</a> and <a href="">ngChange</a> which
      require functionality and variables setup in the controller.
   </p>
   <p>ngChange is an AngularJS implementation of the regular onChange which allows you to use
      an AngularJS Expression. ere we are using it to fire the <code>updateNutrition()</code> function
      when the Activity level is selected.
   </p>
   <p>ngRepeat is basically a "for" loop that repeats the element for each variable in an array.in
      order for this to display correctly add the following to the controller:
   </p>
   ```javascript
   $scope.goals = {
   current: {
   title:"Mainteance"
   ,calories: 0
   ,protein: 0
   ,fats: 0
   ,carbs:0
   }
   ,loss: {
   title:"Fat Loss"
   ,calories: 0
   ,protein: 0
   ,fats: 0
   ,carbs:0
   }
   ,gain:{
   title:"Muscle Gain"
   ,calories: 0
   ,protein: 0
   ,fats: 0
   ,carbs:0
   }
   }
   ```
   <p>This simply creates and initialises the goals object and now our view will look more finalised
      (but not updating yet)
      code so far: <a
         href="https://github.com/jonniedarko/ngmacro/
         commit/57e04d0f188d928445f07682eeab15c3f1f
         aa458">github commit</a>
   </p>
   <p>Now lastly we will add the updateNutrition which will update our goals using the user's BMR
      which we calculated earlier and the the activity level and weight. so add the following to the
      controller:
   </p>
   ```javascript
   $scope.activityLevels = [{
   title: "Little or No Exercise"
   ,description: "You are Lazy and avoid exercise"
   ,value: 1.2
   }
   ,{
   title: "Light Exercise"
   ,description: "Exercise 13
   times a week"
   ,value: 1.375
   }
   ,{
   title: "Moderate Exercise"
   ,description: "Exercise 35
   times a week"
   ,value: 1.55
   }
   ,{
   title: "Heavy Exercise"
   ,description: "You Exercise 67
   times a week"
   ,value: 1.725
   }
   ,{
   title: "Professional Athlete"
   ,description: "You Exercise approximately 2 times a Day"
   ,value: 1.9
   }
   ];
   $scope.updateNutrition=function(){
   if(($scope.user.sex === "male" || $scope.user.sex === "female") &amp;&amp;
   $scope.user.weight>0 &amp;&amp; $scope.user.height>0 &amp;&amp;
   $scope.user.age>0 &amp;&amp; $scope.user.activityLevel>0){
   $scope.goals.current.calories = parseFloat($scope.user.bmr * $scope.user.activityLevel)||
   0;
   $scope.goals.loss.calories = $scope.goals.current.calories * 0.85 || 0;
   $scope.goals.gain.calories = $scope.goals.current.calories * 1.15 || 0;
   $scope.goals.current.protein = $scope.user.weight*2.204 || 0;
   $scope.goals.loss.protein = $scope.user.weight*2.204 || 0;
   $scope.goals.gain.protein = $scope.user.weight*2.204*1.5 || 0;
   $scope.goals.current.carbs = ($scope.goals.current.calories*0.3)/4 || 0;
   $scope.goals.loss.carbs = ($scope.goals.loss.calories*0.15)/4 || 0;
   $scope.goals.gain.carbs = ($scope.goals.gain.calories*0.3)/4 || 0;
   $scope.goals.current.fats = ($scope.goals.current.calories
   ($
   scope.goals.current.protein*4)($
   scope.goals.current.carbs*4))/9 || 0;
   $scope.goals.loss.fats = ($scope.goals.loss.calories
   ($
   scope.goals.loss.protein*4)($
   scope.goals.loss.carbs*4))/9 || 0;
   $scope.goals.gain.fats = ($scope.goals.gain.calories
   ($
   scope.goals.gain.protein*4)($
   scope.goals.gain.carbs*4))/9 || 0;
   }
   };

   <p>Forgetting the complexity of the formulas, all you need to really understand is that it
      calculates the calories, protein, carbs and fats for "Maintenance", "Muscle Gain", and "Fat Loss"
      and adds to the <code>$scope.goals</code> Object.
